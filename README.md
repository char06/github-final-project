# GitHub Final Project

## Description

This project is a simple calculator that calculates simple interest given the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Usage

### Input

- `p`: Principal amount
- `t`: Time period in years
- `r`: Annual rate of interest

### Output

- `simple interest`: Calculated using the formula: simple interest = p * t * r

## How to Use

1. Enter the principal amount (`p`), time period in years (`t`), and annual rate of interest (`r`).
2. The calculator will output the calculated simple interest.

## Example

```python
# Sample Input
p = 1000
t = 2
r = 0.05

# Output
simple_interest = p * t * r
print("Simple Interest:", simple_interest)
